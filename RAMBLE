valuable containerization lessons learned from:
injecting container by hand
using this.store vs App.store

Questions:
why does dayController reload anything when you try to find a record?

When branches are checked into gitlab record original commit times along with reviewer and commiter names
Store this info for 3 months or until reviewers and commiters have both entered time for a day.

Passing in [item]controllers: rewrap vs reopen? If reopen, reopen w/ mixin instead of inline def

If we created days for each month currently under display how do we keep a handle on the group of models which should be discarded when the month is no longer in use IF the records are still in a blank state?
